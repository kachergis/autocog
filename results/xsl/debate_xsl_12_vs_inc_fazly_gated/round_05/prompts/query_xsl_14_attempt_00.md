# query_xsl_14_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a cognitive scientist arguing for one theory of cross-situational word learning against another, using an existing corpus of human data.

## THE TASK AND THE DATA
On each training trial a learner hears several novel words and sees several novel objects, with no indication of which word goes with which; each word's referent is consistent across trials. At test, people choose each word's referent. The corpus has 47 adult conditions that vary words and objects per trial, word frequency, contextual diversity, temporal contiguity, filtering and test format. Both theories are fitted to all of it; their predictions are population means of per-item accuracy (people differ in ability, which the fit models explicitly).

## YOUR MOVE
Propose one CORPUS QUERY: a set of conditions and a statistic of their per-item accuracies on which YOUR theory (xsl_14) should match the human value more closely than the opponent (inc_fazly). Good queries isolate an effect your theory's mechanism produces and the opponent's does not (e.g. a contrast between conditions that differ in one design factor, or a pattern across items within a condition).

The query is evaluated on the human data and on both theories' predictions. It counts only if the two predictions differ by at least 2 standard errors of the human value (estimated by resampling people) - otherwise the data cannot decide it. The theory closer to the human value wins the query. Do not repeat a query already in the ledger.

## OUTPUT
You have no tools and cannot run code: do not write tool calls, XML tags or `<invoke>` blocks. Reply with the JSON object only — no prose before or after it.
Return one JSON object with these fields:
- conditions: Labels of the corpus conditions the statistic uses (at least one).
- metric: Python source defining def metric(acc) -> float, where acc maps each listed condition label to a numpy array of per-item accuracies (proportion correct, in corpus item order). `np` is available. Example: return acc['221'].mean() - acc['222'].mean()
- claim: Which theory should match people better on this statistic, and the mechanism that makes it so.

## THEORIES
### THEORY 1: xsl_14 — held-out NLL 16880.2, held-out wSSE 0.4002
Fitted parameters: d=0.1635, lam=5.999, Mmax=9.733, fl=0.004404, b=1.194, s=0.2981, r=2.114, ch_dec=0.4588, p=1.07, rho=0.2295, th=0.7934, kc=17.16, xi=1, kappa=-0.8956, kpos=0.195, lapse=0.001, ability_sd=1.436

**Name:** Competition-scaled uncommitted returns with pair-count commitment gain

**Description:** The core is kept from xsl_13: competitive, load-limited learning with retrieval-induced interference, a fading contiguity trace, and commitment-gated exclusion with redistributed credit. What changes is how repetition is credited. (1) The diminishing returns for an uncommitted word are no longer a blanket function of its exposure count. They scale with how ambiguous that word's association row currently is (1 - 1/effective number of candidate objects, from the inverse Simpson index). A word in a sparse, consistent design keeps near-linear returns from repetition. A word spread across many candidates, as in dense 4x4 designs, is still throttled and stays near floor. (2) Once a word has committed, its gain grows with the number of consistent co-occurrences of that specific word-object pair, (1+n_pair)^kpos. kpos can be large, so late repetitions keep lifting a committed pair instead of saturating with total word exposure.

**Parameters:**
- d: [0.0, 1.0]
- lam: [0.05, 6]
- Mmax: [0.3, 30]
- fl: [0.0, 0.5]

### THEORY 2: inc_fazly — held-out NLL 17153.6, held-out wSSE 0.5039
Fitted parameters: lambda=0.1469, beta=21.84, lapse=0.001, ability_sd=1.446

**Name:** Probabilistic incremental alignment (Fazly, Alishahi & Stevenson 2010)

**Description:** On each trial every word aligns to each co-present object in proportion to its current probability of meaning that object (smoothed for never-seen pairs); alignments accumulate as associations, and each word's meaning probabilities are the smoothed, normalised associations.

**Parameters:**
- lambda: [1e-10, 2]
- beta: [2, 20000]

**`learn` source:**
```python

    lam, beta = params["lambda"], params["beta"]

    assoc = np.zeros((n_words, n_objects))
    probs = np.zeros((n_words, n_objects))
    t_unseen = np.full(n_words, 1.0 / beta)
    for words, objects in trials:

        unseen = tr == 0
        tr[unseen] = np.broadcast_to(t_unseen[words][:, None], tr.shape)[unseen]

## Response

{"conditions":["216","223"],"metric":"def metric(acc):\n    return acc['216'].mean() - acc['223'].mean()","claim":"xsl_14 should match people better on the accuracy drop from sparse 2x3 (216) to dense 4x4 (223), both with 18-AFC tests. Humans show a large drop of about 0.27. xsl_14 predicts about 0.22 (0.560 vs 0.338). Its ambiguity-scaled returns keep near-linear learning when a word's association row is sparse and consistent, as in 2x3. In the dense 4x4 design the row spreads over many candidate objects, so learning is throttled and stays near floor. inc_fazly predicts a drop of only about 0.02 (0.454 vs 0.435). Its alignment normalisation does not penalise dense designs strongly, and it over-predicts 4x4 accuracy while under-predicting 2x3. It therefore misses the density effect."}
